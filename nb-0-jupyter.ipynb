It allows you to use a web browser (as opposed to a terminal or other software) to interact with a computer language interpreter (typically Python) to send commands and receive outputs. It then displays the outputs in HTML below the executed cells, and allows users to add rich text comments or annotations around code cells using [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (more on this below)."
